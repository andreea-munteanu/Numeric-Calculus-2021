Âˆ Compute, when it is possible, the Cholesky decomposition for matrix A
(A = LLT

elements (lii > 0, âˆ€i) ;
Âˆ Using this decomposition, compute the determinant of matrix A (det A =
det L det L

Âˆ With the above computed LLT decomposition, and using the substitution methods compute an approximative solution xChol for the system

Âˆ Verify that your computations are correct by displaying the norm:

Ainit and b
init are the initial data, not those modified during computations. We denoted by || Â· ||2 the Euclidean norm.

Use any matriceal norm implemented in the employed library.
Âˆ Write (and use) functions for reading vectors and matrices from keyboard, file, random initialisation and functions for displaying vectors

Âˆ Constraint: In your program use only one matrix, A and a vector d
that contains the diagonal elements of the initial matrix A. The LLT
decomposition will be computed and stored in lower triangular part of
matrix A. By using this type of allocation, one does loses the diagonal
elements of matrix A, thus the need to save these elements in vector
d, di = a
init
ii .
Âˆ As input data introduce a matrix that is only symmetric. If this matrix
is not positive definite, the algorithm cannot compute the Cholesky factorization. In this situation stop the computations with an appropriate
error message.
Bonus 25 pt.: Compute the Cholesky decomposition for matrix A with
the following storage restrictions: in your program, use for storing matrices
A and L two vectors of size n(n + 1)/2. In these vectors one stores the
elements from the lower triangular part of these matrices. For matrix A the
elements from the upper triangular part can be accessed using the symmetry
relation. With this new type of data storage, compute the solution of the
linear system Ax = b, xChol.
